Dec 7
Cleaned my bicycle and papa’s. 
The spokes were all rusty 
Practiced all afternoon. 
Then when papa came 
home at night he asked 
mamma and I whether we 
would like to go & hear
Dr Barrie who has just 
returned from South Africa. 
So we went. The meeting 
was held in the First 
Presbyterian Church. Christened 
my new hat. 



Dec 8
Took my lessons this 
morning. Have “Papillion [sic]” by 
Lavallee for next day. He told 
me my rhythm was much 
better than it used to be. 
Got Allie to play for me 
next Wednesday night. She 
has a dear little kitten. 
We have two ducks, spareribs & 
sausage. I think we will have 
enough to eat. Mamma & I were 
uptown in afternoon. I bought 
a rubber doll & horse for the 
Dorsey children. Collin’s Weekly 
is illustrated very nicely 
with colored pictures this week.
