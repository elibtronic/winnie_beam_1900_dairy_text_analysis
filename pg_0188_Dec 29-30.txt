Seems funny to not have to 
take a lesson. Mamma & 
Aunt Allie were uptown 
again to-day. Aunt Allie got 
a capenine[?] of persian Lamb [sic] 
& bearskin for aunt Rebecca. 
She started for Ridgeway on 
the 6.06 train. Did not to [sic] 
much of anything. Eva was 
in to have her hair curled 
last night for their 
entertainment.

Did not go to church this 
morning as I have a bad 
coldsore [sic] on my lip. And by 
Sunday School time it was 
no better so I did not go. 
Eva was over. Brought one 
of her Christmas presents 
“Grandma Elsie” over for me 
to read and I lent her 
“Tip Lewis and this Lamp”. Papa, 
mamma and I went to Church 
at night Sermon on the 
Beatitudes “Blessed are the 
peacemakers”. Came home 
with Coys and papa & mamma 
went to their place with 
them. Papa came home first & Allie 
came with him.
