Aunt Lillie and I went uptown
this morning. We went
to the bazzaar and she
bought two plays and I
brought 1 doz. little ones for
10{c}. We got home after twelve
and the horse came at 2 o'clock
and they started. Saw Frank
Ovenholt at the office. Mamma & I
drove up to Mrs. Sullivan's. She
was ready. Got a piece of red
satin ribbon & black pulley
belt rings for a red belt for my
red waist. Old Mrs. Wand[?] is dead 93 years old.
