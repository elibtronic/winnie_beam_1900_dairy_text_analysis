The Ridley boys were out in full
force yesterday with Kruger's [xxx]
on a stretcher. Yesterday afternoon
was a holiday and the people 
were wild. It was papa's 
birthday yesterday. They had a 
free concert in the Opera House
last night by the band. Got
my music I sent for on Tuesday
and a catalogue besides. Tannhauser
March and Two Larks are pretty, but
the other one is hard.


Mar 8
Took my music lesson Cradle Song 
by Mendelssohn. Mr Read played
an introduction and the first part
of a cycle of Japanese songs. The 
introduction is very pretty and 
is founded upon the Japanese
scale. Mrs Trusty is here.
Mamma and I were uptown.
Mamma got a waist for working
in and me some print for 
a blouse waist. We saw Mrs
Pay and she had just been in 
Dwyer's before she came uptown,
and the thought old Mrs Dwyer
was dying.
