Had a nice rain this
afternoon Butter was
28¢ a lb. Dr Abbott & his
brother from London
drove down & papa was
going with them fishing
but to [?] much rain afraid of
a duckling [?]. Turned out bright
and clear. {Poor} men got [xxx]
their fishing and drive. Mamma
& I were uptown in
afternoon. Bought a silver
heart with a maple
leaf in it. The only
thing that worried me was
the 30¢ I paid for it Leta passed.
