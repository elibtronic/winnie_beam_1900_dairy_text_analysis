February Wednesday 28 1900 
Last night the boys and men
celebrated Cronje's surrender 
by bonfires, firecrackers 
and the band played on.
They stole about $50 worth
of boxes from McLarens and 
sent in a false alarm to get the 
firement out. Mamma wnt to 
church as it is the Ladies Club
monthly meeting. There she staid 
to the first [?] service. To-day is
Ashwednesday. Phoebe got a picture
of Edna Potters. It has been snowing
nearly all day. Papa brought some peanuts home. 



March Thursday 1
When I awoke this morning the
Meritton whistle was blowing
pretty soon the Town went there
St Georges Chruch chimes so I 
knew Ladysmith was relieved
Hurah! It has been blowing 
and snowing Oh! how hard hard.
It is the worst snowstorm 
we have had this year.
Another day in the house.
Mamma strained her wine
to-day. I arranged the pictures 
in my room as I had got 
tired of them. I found a pretty
picture yesterday in an old 
Montreal Store of the Madonna and 
Christ chold so I put it up
