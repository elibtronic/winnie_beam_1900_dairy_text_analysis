September 4
Was reading "Three men on
Wheels" when Mrs Tulley
and Dr Abbott came in.
They wanted papa, mamma
& I to go to the Welland
House for tea. Dr Abbott
hurried up to the office
and caught papa. Had a
very good supper. They
walked home with
us. Mrs Tulley told about
a good books "Uarda" by
Ebeer [sic].



September 5
Mamma and I drove up to
McLaren's and to the library
Changed my book for "A Country
Minister's Love story" by
Maria Bell.  Nell sat down
by McLaren's. I was skeered.
We drove out Martindale
way. Got some plums,
Went over to Carmans and
asked Blanche, Ella & Sam over; but
the gentleman had flown.
Dr Abbott and Mrs Tulley
were down for the last
time. Had melons.
