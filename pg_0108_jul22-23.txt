July 22
I went to Church in the
morning. Sermon on I Samuel
XII 2 & 3 verses. The girls
would not go. Then
I went to Sunday School
and took that awful
class. The lesson "Christ's
Rebuke & Peter's Confession",
They would not pay any
attention to me. The Salvation
Army people had a great time in
the park. The people went
for a drive down through
Port.
