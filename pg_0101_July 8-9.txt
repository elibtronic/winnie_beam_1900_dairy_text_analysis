Very chilly and damp to-day.
Practiced 2 hours to-day
as it was cool. They
intended having the
electric cars running to Falls
to-day but the President

of the city. Had an
excursion in the Park
to-day. Very nice day
for once. Mr & Mrs. Dwyer
were over in the evenening.
Papa & mamma were
hunting dew worms
this evening.
