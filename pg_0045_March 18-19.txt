Mar 18
Did not fo to church in the
morning. It is warmer, but
snowing nearly all the
time. Those Evangelists Crossely
and Hunter{1} are in Toronto.
I suppose the Methodisits will
try to get them here as they
were here a few years ago.
Did not go to Sunday School
but papa, mamma & I went
to church at night. Sermon
St. John XIV & 1 verse. It
was God's appeal to the heart.
Rained at night.

Very broght, and warm this

Harmony for next Saturday
this morning. It is
getting hard. Am at Part
II. Suspensions. Papa said
at noon that water was
very cheap as it has been
thawing and the rain last
night. Intended going to
library and church but
it rained very hard.
