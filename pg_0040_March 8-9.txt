Mrs Dwyer was buried this afternoon
Mamma and I went to church.
We were late. We had Mr Miller
as I suppose Mr Perry was at the 
funeral. Then we went to the Post
Mamma sent for some samples from
Simpson's. We really went to the 
Musical to-night. Mr Williams
led it. Miss Macfarlane played a 
pretty Bercuse by Selytte[?]
and Mr Thompson and Miss Burson[?]
played chaconne by Jadassohn I
liked these the best. It was 
Scandinavian night.


March 9
Went to school. Annie was 
there. She went with me
as far as the library. I
got "A House-Boat on the
Styx", by J. K. Bangs after
so long as I have been 
trying to get it for nearly
a year. Finished it to-night.
We expected Dr and Mrs 
Klotz over to spend
the evening, but they
did not come. Mattie is 
going back in the choir and 
Frank too.
