Got my mudturtles ready.
Put them in the tin tub
after dinner mamma
saw a water lily root on
the ground, and here
Dexter had taken my
mudturtles out and the lilies
Did not find them. Dr Abbott
was down in the afternoon
I had to go over to Carmans
after papa. Saw Sam Carman
Mrs Carman has been away
Rev McKerr's son was buried
this afternoon.



August 25
Did not go to church as
it was too warm. Tried
to find some pictures for a
small frame, but couldn't.
Dr Abbott & Mrs Tulley were
down in the afternoon
and Dr and papa went to
the sixteen. They brought
a basket of apples down
with them. Then they
went back to the hotel
and came down again
after supper. The band has
not given a sacred concert this
year.
