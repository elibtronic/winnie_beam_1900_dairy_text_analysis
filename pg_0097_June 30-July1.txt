Took my last music lesson
before the holidays. Miss
Scott took her lesson after
me. Had to go to Eckhardts.
Miss McCaul is in Miss Macfarlane's
place. Had to get "Fantasiest{u}ck Op 7." by. C.
Reinecke, and Valse Chromatique
Op 88, by Godard to practice
during holidays. Papa & Frank
Oerholt went to Dunnville
this afternoon. Mamma & I
drove out to the bush
after moss. Lizzie was
down.
