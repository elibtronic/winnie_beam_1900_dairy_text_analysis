Jany [sic]                               Friday 4th                     1901
Am reading some of my 
Pansy Books. The one I am 
reading now is a New Graft 
on the Family Tree. Am 
working on edge of my 
doily. Eva left a Birthday 
letter for me at the door, 
but she was mistaken 
in the date. She & Tom 
were in after school. She 
had a quarrel with Marguerite 
Carlisle Am going to send for 
some Brown Pro[xx?] tomorrow.

Saturday 5th
Took my lesson after the 
holidays. Have “Ich Liele Dich” 
again. For next week. Called 
in Dwyers to tell Beatrice she 
had the musical programme 
for the next Young People’s Meeting. 
Finished my doily. Mrs Trusty 
is here. Me. Pearson & man came 
to fix the gas burner. Mamma 
& I were uptown in the 
afternoon. I bought a round 
doily for comb & brush. Sent 
my letter away for the 
pictures.
