Jany [sic]				Thursday 10th				1901
Very horrible day. Raining. 
Didnot [sic] go to the Dr. as it 
was so damp. Counldn’t go to 
church. I am so sorry the 
weather has been so 
bad. Got the pictures from 
Brown’s to–night. There are 
some very pretty ones 
Papa and I played 
euchre. He beat. Expect the 
soldiers home to–morrow. 
Modjeska was at the Opera 
House to–night.



Friday 11th
Woke up with a very bad 
cold in my head. Mrs Marquis 
came to ask me if I 
would play next night Jan 
22nd. French[?] night & to send 
my pieces in. The Dr is sick 
with a cold so I had my walk 
for nothing. It said in the 
paper there were about 300 
children at the church yesterday. 
Papa & I played euchre again 
& I won this time.
