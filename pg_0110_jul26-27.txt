Fixed ourselves all up
fancy, and went uptown
in afternoon. We all were
treated at Jean's to icecream [sic]
by mamma. Went in the
stamp store. Got a
watermelon & some banana
Papa took a fish over to Coy's
then we went up to
the band concert.
They played a pretty medley
with national airs woven
in.
