In the afternoon I went
uptwon. Called for Beatrice
but she was out with
Percy. Went to Eckhardt's
Got my pieces to-day.
Mr. Thomspon was in there.
Went to Dunn's and bought
a shamrock for to-morrow.

euchre.



march 17
St. Patrick's Day. Took my
music lesson. Mr Read
asked me where my green
was and told me to come home
and put it on. Took the "Marsh"[sic]{1}
by Hollaender. The other was
wrong and I had to take it 
back. I wanted the one by
Benj. Godard and the one I got 
was by Ch. Godard and was
not much good. Very cold.
Mamma and I did the
ironing as Mrs Trusty did
not come.
