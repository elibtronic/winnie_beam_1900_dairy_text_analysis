October 12

Did not practice much
to-day. After dinner
mamma and I
went for a drive. We
drove to Sixteen and
got a tick[?] and
looking glass out of
the cottage. Pappa wanted
to take them up
North with him.
Got some very hard
apples on the tree by
cottage



October 18

Took my music IV. of
Jadassohn's OP 26. Eva
came over and she is going
to the Falls. Papa and
mamma started right after
dinner for the twenty. I
washed the dishes and
ironed some small things.
Mrs Trusty did our washing to-day
Then Phoebe and I went
uptown. She got a skirt and
took Paderewski to have him
framed. Eva bought me a Union
Jack Hatpin from Falls. Mamma
found some lovely apples in the
marsh. I made some candy
with chocolate in "Fudge".
