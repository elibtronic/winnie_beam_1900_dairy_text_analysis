My cold is worse and 
papa would not let me 
go to my lesson. It is the 
first one I have ever missed. 
Papa is going to tell Mr Read. 
Mamma had to go uptown and do 
a dozen errands. She went to 
Mrs Marquis & told her I could 
not play at the next Musical. 
Mamma changed my library 
book & got “Twice Tried” by Anne Swan. 
I am to go to Miss Boyle’s Monday. 
The soldier boys are home 
and have a good time. 



Sunday 13th
Did not go out all day. 
Ate peanuts, Lizzie was 
down after Sunday School 
to see what was the 
matter with us all. She 
was telling us Mr Perry 
has got out souvenirs, a 
picture of himself. Papa, 
& mamma went to 
church.
