July 6
Very warm. It has been
the worst day this year.
All the foreigners are supposed
to have been killed in
Pekin. I am kniting
a wash cloth. Did not
stir much. We are to
have a memorial service
in our church Sunday
for R. Irwin who died in
Smith Africa July 1. He was
of first contingent.
Mrs. Carman & Ella were
over to see the rambler.



July 7
went to market after
peas, and to Eckhardt's
after my music. Got Godard's
"Valse Chormatique", but not
the other. Was at Wilsons.
Had a large excursion in
the Park for Toronto. The
Dominion Radiator Co. They
had a baseball match between
Park nine & themselves. Had
the Grenadier Band. Papa &
mamma went frog-shooting.
The Buffalo Tennis Club
played a match with ours
this afternoon.
