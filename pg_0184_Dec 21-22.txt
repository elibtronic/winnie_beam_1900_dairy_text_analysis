Mamma is not feeling well to-day 
Mrs Trusty came in the 
afternoon to iron. Mamma & 
I went uptown. Mamma got 
Eva a silver bean for her 
bracelet & we got a little 
strawberry cream pitcher for 
Annie Trusty. I bought papa 
a Fountain pen, at Fairfield’s. 
There is a confirmation in 
St. George’s to-night. Miss 
McLaren & Mrs Moore have a 
ball to-night.



Dec 22
Took my lesson. Have “Ich liebe 
dich” for two weeks from 
to-day as I don’t have to take a 
lesson next week. A lovely 
day. Called in Coy’s. Mattie 
cannot sing. Miss Clarke came 
to give Dell a lesson. I went 
out in the afternoon. Took Lizzie’s 
calendar called at Chapman’s 
to see if Genevra could sing. She 
is away. Went to Greenwood’s. Mabel 
will sing I was up to office and 
papa gave me money to get Eva a 
hatpin. Got a sample copy of 
the “Musician” for December. Sent Aunt 
Allie’s bag off. Was at Dwyer’s. Beatrice 
was uptown. Then went down to 
Dudley’s.
