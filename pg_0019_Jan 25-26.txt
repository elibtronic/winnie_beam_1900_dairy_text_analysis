January Thursday 25 1900
Went to school in afternoon, the 
Inspector was there, dear man, I 
did not try to answer questions. 
Mr Henderson lent Miss Dougan 
Miss Benson & I his umbrella 
as it was raining hard when 
we came out of school. Ella came
over and brought "Dolly Dialogues"
home. She borrowed our rat trap
At night it snowed and blew 
phew! and I could not go to the 
Musical which I was very sorry 
for as it was Russian night & Miss Mc
Farlane played. Pap brought some candy.


Friday 26
We burnt a lamp last night as 
the gasbills are so high. It is very 
nice to burn lamps. Did not go 
to school this morning as it was 
cold & blustry. 10{0} below zero.
Mr Carman came over with a 
rat for Pansy to catch it, and 
the naught thing wouldn't as the 
rat bit him on the lip. Mamma 
Mrs Coy and Mattie went to Mrs
C. Moore's card party in afternoon 
from 3 to 6 o'clock Mrs Dudley 
won first Miss Bate the second 
and Miss Kate Clark the third 
prize. The first was a tea cozey, 2{nd} 
an orange knife, the third a 
book.
