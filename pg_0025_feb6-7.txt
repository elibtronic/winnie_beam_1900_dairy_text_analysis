February Tuesday 6 1900 
I got out of going to school to-day
and it was a good thing as 
Miss Cloney was cranky
Had fun with Dexter. Shovelled 
the snow off the verandeh,
and the steps. Then threw
snowballs at him. Leta came 
over to have me go with 
her uptown. It was after
five when we went. Tait's have
an imitation pipe organ in 
their window covered with 
silver sheen dress lining. 


Wednesday 7 
Went to school in morning 
Annie Gardiner was there. There 
was a little dog waiting outside 
the door for some one, but I did 
not let him in. Mamma 
went to the church. Auxiliary 
Day. There are to have the pound 
socail Friday night. Papa had 
to go over to the station to 
meet one of the big guns of the 
Lodge as they have a blowout 
to-night Dr Butler of 
Buffalo, and Mr Waterson of 
Brantford are here to attend 
it. Judge Senkler is to be buried 
in Brockville.
