April 7
Took my music lesson. Mr
Read heard some good news
about me. Someone from the
college said I was the best young
player in Musical. He wants me
to go to the closing, and after it
start in Sept. to go and practice
duos, quartettes & c. He gave me Basque
Danse, one of his own. I went over
to Leta's in afternoon. Mrs Dudley
she and I went uptown. She
got a new pair of shoes.

some of the Brown pictures
in my room when I got
home. Went to Sunday School

lesson on the paper was "Christ
Crucified". but Mrs Haun
