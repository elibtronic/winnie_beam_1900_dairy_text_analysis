February Friday 16 1900 
Went to school in the morning 
and Miss Gardiner was really 
there with a nice cold. It 
is quite cold out. Kimberley 
has been relieved. Hurrah 
for the British, and bad luck 
to the Boers. Papa is invited 
out to-night to a stay 
party. It is Mr McGhie's
birthday, and Mrs McGhie
is getting up a surprise 
party for him.
