September 8
Took my first music lesson
after the holidays. Had
to go to Eckhardt's after
Kullak's Octave Studies, Bal
Masque by Jadassohn, Valse by
Wrangell. Saw Miss McFarlane
She has been away three months
Eva was over and she brought
some transfer pictures and Jessie
Jones & Eva transferred them out on
the verandeh. Rode up to McLaren's
and then I forgot a post card to
Dr Abbott and had to go again. Papa
& mamma were out to lake. Got our elderberries.
