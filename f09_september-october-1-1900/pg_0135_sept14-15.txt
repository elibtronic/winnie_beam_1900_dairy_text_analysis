took Dexter along, I rode
up to the post and to
Hodgins on my wheel.

September 15
Took my music lesson.
Did not take any of my
new music as I have to finish
the old. Mr Read played us[?] a
solo for a Cantata he is
composing. This solo was on the
death of Saul and Jonathan. I told
him about "The Throne of David"
Started Harmony again. Rode uptown
and changed my libary book
Got "The Tragedy of Wild River
Valley" by Martha Findley. I tried to
get "When Knighthood was in Flower".
Mr Read told me about it. Mamma
was uptown. Mrs Pay has been
sick.
