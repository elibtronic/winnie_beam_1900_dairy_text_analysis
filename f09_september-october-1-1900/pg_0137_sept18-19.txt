Mamma went collecting
this afternoon. I went
over to shoe Hospital on
James St. to have my old
slipper patched. Saw Beatrice.
Went to library and
got "Danesbury House"
By Mrs Henry wood. The
catalogue no [number] fit [sic] was wrong.
Had the last band concert of
the season. Played in pavilion
and charged admission for a 
Family Beaver/, Mr Coy came 
home with papa.

I guess Eva is away as we
have not seen her since
Sunday. Mamma and I
drove on Martindale
way to the lake after
sand. The apples cover 
the ground in some places
and peach trees broken from
the high wind we had
last week. Mr Perry
called and we were out
as usual. Papa has been
talking about me going to
demill. He had to go meet
to meet Mr Marquis and Sidney
Bunting.
