August 13
Very damp and cool
out to-day. I made
some maple cream
with hickory nuts
in to-night. Mamma
went over to Carman's
to have Ella show her
how to do darning needle
work. Had two students
in church last night.
Papa paid me $2.00. Pansy
caught a mouse in paper
basket



August 14
Mamma went to Welland
House to call on Dr Abbott's
sister. I dressed and
went down to Miss
Crawford's but nobody
was home. Called in
Dwyer's and Beatrice was
not home. Mrs Dwyer
thought she had gone to St
David's for tea. Mabel came
after the towels and brought
a little Skye terrier pup
Looks like rain again
to-night. Kid's night in the
park but I do not think
the band played.
