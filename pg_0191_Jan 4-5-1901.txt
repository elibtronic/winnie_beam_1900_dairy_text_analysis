Jany [sic]                               Friday 4th                     1901
Am reading some of my
Pansy Books. The one I am
reading now is a New Graft
on the Family Tree. Am
working on edge of my
doily. Eva left a Birthday
letter for me at the door,
but she was mistaken
in the date. She & Tom
were in after school. She
had a quarrel with Marguerite
Carlisle Am going to send for
some Brown Pro[xx?] tomorrow.



Saturday 5th
Took my lesson after the
holidays. Have “Ich Liele Dich”
again. For next week. Called
in Dwyers to tell Beatrice she
had the musical programme
for the next Young People’s Meeting.
Finished my doily. Mrs Trusty
is here. Mr Pearson & man came
to fix the gas burner. Mamma
& I were uptown in the
afternoon. I bought a round
doily for comb & brush. Sent
my letter away for the
pictures.
