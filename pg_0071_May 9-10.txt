May 9
The little wood stove smoked
and blacked the spare bedroom
ceiling. Mrs Trusty is here,
washed & ironed. Gave her
my black & green wool jacket.
Went over to Meyer's after
gingersnaps. In the paper
to-night it gave the
programme in the
church. Very cold.

Mamma cleaned the spare room.
I went over to Dwyer's in
afternoon to see Beatrice.
She is going to Galt &
Winona to-morrow. And
she was just going for a
drive when came so I
did not stay. When I came
home Allie came over, which is
a wonder as she has not
been here since Fall.
Mamma went to Mrs.
Sullivan's and she was not
ready. Papa brought a new
magazine called Ainslee's Magazine
Do not care much for it.
