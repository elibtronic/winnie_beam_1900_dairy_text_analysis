November 1

I went up to the post to
mail some letters and
papers for papa as it
was so rainy we couldnt
go yesterday. Cleaned the
parlor. Then mamma
and I painted the kitchen
floor with first coat. Borowed
some brands[?] from Mrs
Carman. Tom was in and
wanted to paint, but we
did not let him.



November 2

Mamma cleaned the halls.
I fixed some blue velvet
ribbon for a tie. Miss
Seymour was here collecting
for the Bible Society.
Mamma and I went
uptown. Frank Coy is
much better. Had a card from
papa. [???] Floyd appealed
and she did not get it
so she has to go down
stairs again with the
bids. Mrs Pay took us
through her house.
