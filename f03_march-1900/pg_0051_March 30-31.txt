Carrie is seriously ill in Santa
Barbara. Mr Gould started there 
on Wednesday. I sent for 
26 picutes from Brown & Co. this
morning. Went uptown when 
mamma was sweeping to 
the Post and Library. Got The
Pursuit of the House Boat,
by John K. Bangs. Laura brought
the buttermilk. Mr Coy wanted
papa to go to the Opera House
to-night. The play is 
"Zaza"[?].

Took my lesson. Took the 17{th}
Etude ad Valse Serenad{e}
by Godard. Mrs Trusty came
to iron Mamma and I
went uptown. It was
premium day at stamp
store. Got 10 stamped. Mamma
got a new waist called
coin spot at Tait's and I 
got two rings for a pulley
belt, the newest belt. Saw
Mr Armstrong in Walker & Abbs
and he was asking me
whether I had been having
better luck than when I saw
him last.
