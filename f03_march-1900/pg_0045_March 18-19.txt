Mar 18
Did not fo to church in the 
morning. It is warmer, but
snowing nearly all the
time. Those Evangelists Crossely
and Hunter{1} are in Toronto.
I suppose the Methodisits will
try to get them here as they
were here a few years ago.
Did not go to Sunday School
but papa, mamma & I went
to church at night. Sermon
St. John XIV & 1 verse. It 
was God's appeal to the heart.
Rained at night.
