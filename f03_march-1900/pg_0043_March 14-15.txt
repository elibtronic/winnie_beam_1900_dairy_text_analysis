march 14
Mrs Trusty was here this
morning. Did not go to
school. Mrs Jeeves was
buried this afternoon.
Papa went to the house.
The coffin was a mass
of flowers. Mrs L. Smith
came over this afternoon,
and cut out a new waist 
pattern. Mr Coy sent over
some moose steak. First
we ever had. Mr Coy is 
alone and he had a few friends
in. Papa went over. 

March 15
Guess I won't go to school
any more. I went over to 
Lee's and I met Allie.
She was going up to the 
millnery openings. Bobs[sic]
is in Blonfontein [sic] and 
sleeping in Steyn's house.
I went to see Mrs Dwyer and
uptown. She came to 
church too. Mr Perry spoke
on Matt VII. 7. Seek and ye shall find
ask & receive, knock and it shall be
opened. We got our goods from
Murray & Co. for shirtwaists and 
mamma got enough goods at Tait's for one.
