March 22
Mamma went out collecting
and then she went
uptown and to church.
She got my piece Valse
Serenade Op 71 by Godard. 
We went to the Musical
at night Mrs Marquis
played the prettiest one
Premiere Nazuska by Strelezki
Allie played, but I did
not like her piece.
Got a letter from
Mamie.


March 23
I started to read "In
Black & White by Kipling
but it is very funny.
I do not care much for it. 
Mrs Len Smith was over
in the afternoon. Got
the Ladies home Journal.
I am reading "The Parson's
Butterfly" in it. It is a nice
story. I had to go over to 
Lee's before tea. Mrs Smith
was with me. Laura
brought us buttermilk. Mamma
was down to see Maggie about
making Aunt Allie a dress.
