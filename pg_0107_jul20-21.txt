July 20
Leta is going to Toronto to-day. I
had to go uptown in the
morning. Got 1/2 yd. of velvet
ribbon for my hair at Anderson's.
It rained very hard last night.
Finished "Throne of David." I
enjoyed it, and think I will
get "The Pillar of Fire" as I have
read the two other ones. Marrie &
Janie Stuart came this afternoon
Lizzie & Miss Toll [?] were down at night
Lizzie wants me to take her class
Sunday. I have consented, byt oh!
