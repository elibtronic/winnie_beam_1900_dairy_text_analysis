Beatrice came after me this
morning to go with her to
St. Paul St. Church to practice
as she did not like to
go alone. She is going to
supply for Miss Vanderburgh.
Went to McLaren's after and
then she treated me in Jean's to
an ice cream soda. Practiced in
afternoon. Then went up
to Mc.Laren's after 2 puff ties
for a quarter. Lizzie was
down to see Phoebe at
night.
