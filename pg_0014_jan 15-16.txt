January Monday 15 1900 
Went to school in morning, 
but had my walk for 
nothing for they had the 
weekly examinations. Miss
Fowler on Queen St. died 
yesterday in the hospital. 
Papa got five books at 
night. Premaums [?] with the 
"Hall Hour" Four by A. Conan 
Doyle and one by Robert Louis 
Stevenson. It rained very 
hard at night. 


Tuesday 16
Went to school in afternoon. 
Papa went to Hamilton to-night 
to the Hamilton Gun Club shoot. 
Called in Dwyer's in afternoon to 
see if she would go with
mamma & I to Knox Church 
to-night. Mamma & I called 
for her at night. They had an 
entertainment called "Jerusha 
Dow's Family Album. It 
was fine. Mrs McClive was 
the grandmother and explained 
each picture. Mrs McGhie
came home with us. Lost 
my little black pin from my 
skirt.
