Got a Christmas Globe yesterday 
for 25¢ for Phoebe for Mrs Uttler[?]. At 
noon we got some presents 
from Mame a handkerchief 
for mamma, a book about 
Burningham for Phoebe & a 
calendar for me. Aunt 
Allie & I have been 
washing dishes. Got all 
my Harmony done. Hurrah!

Have been fixing pictures nearly 
all day. I had to wash the 
dinner dishes as mamma 
had to go uptown with 
Aunt Allie about her cape. 
She bought a new skirt. 
Papa, mamma & I went to 
A. Macgregor’s as the club met 
there Colin Macgregor was there & 
Mr & Mrs S. Jenkon[?] Mrs Dwyer 
won ladies, Mr Pay gentlemen’s 
Mr Dwyer the booby[?]. They 
were a pomade[?] glass. A very large 
cup and a paperweight.
