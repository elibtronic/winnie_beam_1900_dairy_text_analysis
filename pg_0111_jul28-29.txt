Went to church in the
morning. Sermon about Saul
performing the sacrifice instead
of waiting for Samuel. I have
forgotten the passage, but it was
in Samuel. Then I went
to Sunday School. The lesson
was "The Transfiguration" Had
Mrs Chatfield. Miss Francis
has taken Lizzie's class for August.
Mr Perry wanted to know whether
I would take it, but Lizzie told
him I had enough of it.  Pappa, Mamma
& I went to church at night. Sermon
2 Cor. 12.-10. It was raining hard
when we came out. So we
waited & Papa went home for wraps.
