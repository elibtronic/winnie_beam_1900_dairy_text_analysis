Dec 31
A rather gloomy day. Mamma swept
this morning. Finished
Eva’s book. In the afternoon
we got a very pretty
azaela [sic]. Think it came
from Mrs Pay. Papa
went to the Falls to-
night, and will go to
Black Creek in the morning.
Fern Healy was down
at night to see about
Wednesday night. Dr Greenwood
was here at night



Tuesday, January 1st 1901
The first day of the 20th century
They had a service in
the church last night
Got some old medicine
this morning. Eva was
over. Papa came home
to–night. He never told
Mattie last night at all
and now I don’t know
who to get for to-morrow.
