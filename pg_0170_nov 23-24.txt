This morning I went uptown
after my pins and to
change my library book.
Got "Leofwine the Monk".
Very nice day. Mamma
went uptown in the
afternoon. McLaren's and
Anderson's have their Christmas
things in. The Collegiate Cadets
have a concert to-night. Miss
Murray is to sing, Miss McCallum
recite and the flag is to be
presented to the cadets.
