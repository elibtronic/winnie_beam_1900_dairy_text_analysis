Miss McFarlane brought my 
music last night. Took my
lesson. Took "Harlequin" by
H. N. Bartlett for my lesson.
Have the first chorale in
Harmony for next week. Went
to Dwyers to ask Beatrice to 
play. Saw their new dog and cats.
Got ten pictures from the 
Perry Pictures last night. Have a
cold. Went and had my
waist tried on. She will not
have it done until Monday.

Sunday morning. Had her hair 
all frizzed. She is going to get
2 [???] scarfpins to sell and
get a watch. Went to

to the old maris[?] who let
him have Dewey with[?]
a piece of venison. Did not
go to Sunday School. Mamma 
has a bad cold.
