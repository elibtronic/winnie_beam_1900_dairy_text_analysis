Muddy to-day Mrs O'Loughlin
called on mamma. I was
over to Lee's and coming
home. I saw Eva. She has
her pins. These are prettier
than the others.
Mamma was over to 
Carman's. "The Wide Wide
World" and "Success" came
to-night. Finished my 
harmony. Franck Overholt
gave papa six quail.

raisins, & citron. Mamma made
a cake for the church. She
