November 15

Papa went to the office
in the morning then
came home early in
the afternoon as Frank
Overholt was coming to
help him skin the deer.
Papa got the picture of the 
twins. I was uptown to
Eckhardt's. Did not get
what I was after. Had
my waist tried on. Wrote
out papa's diary to-night.

I got a book in the 
library yesterday "A Strange
Temptation" by Mrs Spender.
Mamma went uptown
in the afternoon for 
some cake and to see if
they wanted her to help at 
the church. Papa went with 
mamma & I then came
back later. I was talking
with Eloise Hamilton then I got
with Grace & Mayde Greenwood, Allie &
Mallie, & Bessie Elliot. Mr Skey[?] &
Mr Lane gave speeches and
Beatrice & I played. Had a very
good time. I have to play on
Wednesday.
