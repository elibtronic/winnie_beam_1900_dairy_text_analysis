January Friday 19 1900 
Was at school in the morning 
Sat with Leta. Papa came
home from Hamilton last
night. Practiced in afternoon. 
Mamma made a very pretty 
cushion for parlor. Tapestry front 
and brown back. Papa brought 
us some candy at night. He 
bought three tickets for the 
Redpath Concert Co. that is to be 
here on Tuesday. Mr Read & Mr 
Macgregor are bringing them here. 
Wrote a letter to Aunt Allie


Saturday 20
Took my music lesson. Took 
the 7{th} Etude (as I did not prectice 
it for this week as I had too 
many reviews) and Mendelssohn's 
"Fr{u}hlingslied". It was raining 
when I went, and has been 
raining all day. Mrs Trusty 
came to iron through all the
wet. Mamma is making 
another cushion. It is of 
peacock blue sateen covered 
with Battenburg. In my 
Harmony I had to work out 
from exercises in Open instead 
of Close Position.
