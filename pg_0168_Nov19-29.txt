Very gloomy and rainy
all day. Mr J. P. Merritt
died yesterday afternoon
about 6.30. Have been
harmonizing "God Save the
Queen" in Soprano and do it
in Tenor to-morrow.
about 5 o'clock I took
some venison in to
Tucker's




November 20

Rainy again I wish we
could see the sun once
more. My cold is worse
to-day. In the afternoon
Eva came in then went
home again & I was dressing
and she came upstairs with
my Christmas present; a
mother of pearl mudturtle booch.
I went to Pays, Dwyers,
and Hodgetts with venison,
and to Myer's after molasses.
Bessie Read's father died
yesterday. Mr and Mrs Coy and
Sidney were over at night. A meeting
of the active members of the
Musical Circle was held at Miss Vanderburghs'
to-night, but I did not go.
