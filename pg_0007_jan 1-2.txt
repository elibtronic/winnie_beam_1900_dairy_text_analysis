January New Year's Day Monday 1 1900
New Year. First day of 1900 Charlie 
Merritt died at Grand Forks 
British Columbia yesterday of 
typhoid fever. To-day is 
election day and pap went 
up about 3 o'clock and did 
not get back until nearly 
10. He brought us some candy 
chocolate drops. We had a very 
fat goose for dinner, not a 
very young one. Had to have
good teeth. 


Tuesday 2 
Went uptown in afternoon.
Was up to Eckardt's but Miss
Macfarlane was not there so I did 
not get what I wanted. Called at
office and Nettie came home
with me for tea. Mr Carman 
came over and borrowed
my Mildred books. Then
Leta came & borrowed my 
German Grammar as she forgot
hers & left it at school before holiday.
Papa, mamma, Nettie & I played 
crokinole. Mamma & I beat. The 
Kind [?] Contingent left for Toronto today
to go to South Africa. Dr King's spm 
went.
