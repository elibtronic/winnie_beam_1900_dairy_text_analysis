August 25
Did not go to church as
it was too warm. Tried
to find some pictures for a
small frame; but couldn't.
Dr Abbott & Mrs Tulley were
down in the afternoon
and Dr and papa went to
the sixteen. They brought
a basket of apples down
with them. Then they
went back to the hotel
and came down again
after supper. Shy baud [??] has
not glueu [??] a sacred concert this
year.
