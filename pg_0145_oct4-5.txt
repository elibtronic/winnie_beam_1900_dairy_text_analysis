Mamma had to go down to
the fair at 1 o'clock. Cab called
for her. So I had to clear
the dinner & c.[?]. Then after
I got through I rode
uptown to Inksater's as
I ordered some cotton on Tuesday
and it has not came yet.
Miss Muir and her mother
called. Mamma said the
fair is no good. Got
four tickets.

I thought I would rather
go to Decew Falls hunting
mushrooms than go to
the fair so mamma &
I went. We got quite a
few. It was fun. Coming
home we saw some of
the prize cattle & horses.
Coming from the fair. Saw
some red pigs. Eva came over
to show me her cards but
I was not home. Papa
had to go to lodge for
a supper and great
doings[?] they are to have
to-night.
