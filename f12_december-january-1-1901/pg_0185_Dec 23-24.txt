Dec 23
Very rainy about church 
twice[/?] so I did not go in 
the morning. Eva brought 
papa a piece of Chyrianthe[?]. 
Went to Sunday SChoo with 
Mrs Haun’s present. Lesson 
Matt II. 1-18. Mrs Haun surprised 
us by giving each one a 
prayer & hymn book, then 
we surprised her. Lizzie was 
there. Papa, mamma & I were 
at church. Sermon on Beatitudes 
Matt V, 8. Papa went for a walk. 
The Young People’s Association is postponed 
for a week after all my trouble.

Dec 24
I did not intend going uptown 
but McLauren sent the tabourette 
I got for mamma and it 
was all scratched so I went 
up to give them a setting our. 
They did not have another like 
it so I have to give 30¢ more. 
Mamma got Tommy a ball 
& Phoebe got him a box of 
candy. Mamma gave Dell Coy a 
box of candy. Itook Eva and Tom’s 
presents over. Papa went 
uptown at night.
