noon we got some presents 
from Mame a handkerchief 
for mamma, a book about 
Burningham for Phoebe & a 
calendar for me. Aunt 
Allie & I have been 
washing dishes. Got all 
my Harmony done. Hurrah!

Have been fixing pictures nearly 
all day. I had to wash the 
dinner dishes as mamma 
had to go uptown with 
Aunt Allie about her cape. 
She bought a new skirt.

A. Macgregor’s as the club met 
there Colin Macgregor was there & 
Mr & Mrs S. Jinkon[?] Mrs Dwyer 
won ladies, Mr Pay gentlemen’s 
Mr Dwyer the booby[?]. They 
were a [?]made glass. A very large 
cup and a paperweight.
