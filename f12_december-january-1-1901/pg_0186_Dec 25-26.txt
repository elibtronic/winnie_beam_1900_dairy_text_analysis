Merry Christmas & C- Eva was over 
early with her presents. I went

was uptown. I was going to stay

with him. The first thing we saw was 
the deer’s head, & then Dr Harry sent 
me a lovely 2 lb. box of candy, papa 3 boxes of 
cigars & Mrs Tulley sent mamma a handker-
chief. Mrs Overholt sent a teapot handle. 
Ate & ate till we are sick. Tom brought 
his presents in. Lizzie brought me a pretty little 
blue pincushion. I was down to Smith’s for 
some grapes for Eva as she was afraid.
