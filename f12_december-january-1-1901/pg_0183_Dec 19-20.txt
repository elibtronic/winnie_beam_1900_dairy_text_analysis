Got our new set of dishes 
from McLaren’s so mamma 
& I had a washing time

here. Mamma went uptown 
by herself this afternoon.
I went over to Coy’s to see 
if Mattie would sing next

new fur coat from everybody.

Yesterday morning I fixed a 
picture of Pharoah’s[sic] horses on 
a piece of gray mat I had 
left. We are making fruit 
cake. Eva come in early 
this morning with her 
eyes as large as saucers 
said “I have bad new” 
The next door neighbors 
have diptheria [sic]. Dr O’Glynn 
and Sidney were here 
for tea. They played 
King Pedro after. 
[note: King Pedro is a card game]
