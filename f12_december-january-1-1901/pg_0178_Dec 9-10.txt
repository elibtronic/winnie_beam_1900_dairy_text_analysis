In the afternoon I went 
uptown to change two 
presents I got on Saturday 
for Phoebe. They did not 
suit. Then I went to the 
library and got the 
“Etude” from Jany [sic] to June 
1900. Mamma was out 
calling. Called on Mrs 
Dwyer, Dudley, McLean. Mrs Dwyer 
is going to have the club 
Thursday night as Perry [Percy?] 
is coming home to-night.
