Mamma went up to the 
church to help quilt. 
Then at night I got 
ready and was to meet 
Beatrice at Pay’s. Ida Ross 
was with them. A little 
kitten followed us in the 
church. Mrs Perry took it home. 
Molly Phelps & Nora McClelland played Mabel 
Greenwood sang. The debate was, “Slate 
Support in higher education is not 
beneficial to Canada.” The affirmative 
were Mr Prior, Fern Healey & the negative 
Mr. Richards & Roy Grabb; the negative won.

Eva is sick and came over this 
morning, I was ready to go 
uptown. Eva came over and 
went with me. She bought 
a rose for me at Mrs Whiting’s[?] 
and the old thing broke off 
about ten minutes after. Was 
to Miss Andersons to try on 
my hat. It looks swell. 
Eva bought her mother a 
calendar and then went to the 
church to practice. I called into 
Chapman’s to see if Genevra would 
sing next Wednesday night as 
I have change of the programme 
then called at Allie’s & she was 
out so I was disappointed all around.
