February Sunday 4 1900
Did not do much all day. In 
the morning it was snowing 
hard, then about Sunday 
School time and night the 
same old thing so I staid 
at home all day which I did
not like. Teased Parsy by tying 
meat on a string. Read some 
in "Ben-Hur" as I have forgotten 
it, read some in a "Trip 
Through Europe and a Case 
of Identity" by A Conan 
Doyle. 


Monday 5 
Went to school in the morning 
They got back their German 
examination papers so we did 
not have much of a lesson
Stopped in mrs Pay's on my 
way home. They had first
recived a picture off Mrs &
Mr Pay of South Africa in their 
carriage and a Christmas card.
Mamma & Mrs Pay called on 
Mrs Dudley, Mrs J Notman and 
Mrs G Armstrong Papa and 
mamma went to Pay's at
night. Lizzie came down 
came about 2 min. after they 
left
