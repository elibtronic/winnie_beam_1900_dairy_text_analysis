Took my last music lesson
before the holidays. Miss
Scott took her lesson after
me. Had to go to Eckhardts. 
Miss McCaul is in Miss Macfarlane's
place. Had to get "Fantasiest{u}ck Op 7." by. C.

during holidays. Papa & Frank 
Oerholt went to Dunnville
this afternoon. Mamma & I 
drove out to the bush 
after moss. Lizzie was
down.
