Mamma & I drove to Decew Falls 
in afternoon. Stopped to get
some wild strawberries
that grow on a small hill 
in a field as you turn to 
go to Decew. They were dried
up. Got a few. Then we got
some more beyond the
Falls. Got an invitation to 
Demill Commencement 
exercises next week. Lizzie
was down to get Dr. Macfarlane's
address for Maud Rottineier.
