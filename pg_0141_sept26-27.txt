Wash day Annie Trusty was
here begging for the
Salvation army. I had to
take the money to the
church. Gave it to Mr Perry.
Gave Mrs Trusty my pink
waist. Mamma went to
Miss Anderson's. Got me a
"Scribbling Pad". A hat is
going to come to-morrow
she picked out.

Mamma hats came this
morning, but she decided
after dinner not to keep
any. We drove up Mary
St. and I took them back
Then we drove out to
Overholt's. Saw Mrs Williams
Mrs Overholt was in town.
They have a cute little collie
pup. Papa went to office
them to Opera house to Miss
Blackwell's recital. Will
Thompson played, and
Miss Vanderburgh accompanist.
