About 10 o'clock who marched
in but Bessie, and she
wanted me to drive home
with her. She had taken her
cousin to the trolley & she had her
grandmother Cowie's horse I went
with her. We staid [sic] at Cowie's
for a while & I had refreshments.
Then we started our walk in
the awful hot sun got to Overholts
about 12 o'clock. Saw some scorpions
centipedes, tarantulas, lizards
& a snake Frank brought from Africa
