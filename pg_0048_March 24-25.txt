Took my music lesson. Took
16{th} Etude. I have to copy
the Harmony from the full
score to the open using 
the treble, alto, tenor, and 
bass clef's. In the afternoon
Leta came after me and 
we were down to her aunts
and then uptown. Mamma
was uptown, and bought
me goods for a shirtwaist
red and white. Mrs Pay
has been sick.
