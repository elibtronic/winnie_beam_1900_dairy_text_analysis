September 6
Mrs Tulley started for New York
this morning and Dr Abbott
was going to the Bridge
with her. Miss Mabel
Groome has started to give
lessons to a "limited" number.
Eva was here in the afternoon
They have a new grammar
and geography. Then Eva
and her kitten were in after
tea. She had me running
and playing hide & seek.

Canned tomatoes this morning
Very cool to-day. Mamma
and I went for a drive
We went down to Fraser's
to see about our elderberries
and someone had stolen all
of them. Then we drove to
Homer to order Damson plums
from Mr Dow [?]. We came up a
road I have never been
on. Eva was over at night
Mr Inksater's little boy is
dead.
