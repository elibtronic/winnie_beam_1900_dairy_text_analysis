January Sunday 7 1900
My birthday 18 years Oh! I am getting 
very old. The first Sunday 
in the new year. Went to 
church in the morning. Mr
Perry read an address from the 
Bishops of the different dioceses
for Foreign & Canadian missions
Did not go to Sunday School as it 
was raining. Read some in my new
History of Music. It is very interesting.
Papa, mamma & I went to
church at night. Test[?] 'There is salvation 
in no other" Charlie merrit was buried this afternoon.



Monday 8
I really started to school this 
morning. Staid [sic] home & practiced
in afternoon as the club meets
to-night at Dwyers. Papa had
to go to Lodge first so mamma & 
I went. There was hardly any of 
the club there. Mrs Klotz & Mr &
Mrs Marshall were there. Mrs Klotz 
won the ladies prize a little 
hot water teapot & papa won the 
gentleman's an ebony hat brush. 
Waldeman[?] Klotz called for his 
mother. I played some & so did
he. Mrs Pays niece Alice Boyle 
died on Sunday.
