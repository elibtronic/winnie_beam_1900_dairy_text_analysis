February Thursday 22 1900
Did not go out of the house 
all day Mamma made 
a fruit cake. I painted on
a toy drum Mamma has
got for the booby Monday.
"Something you can beat" 
Papa went from Toronto to 
Buffalo to the Mason's 
banquet in honor of the Grand 
Master of New York. I wanted to 
go to the Musical but oh! my 
the weather so I played 
selections from Schubert & Bach [xx]
as it was German night and and dreamt I was there


Friday 23
Went to school. Annie Gardiner
was there, and she asked 
me to go uptown with her so 
I did. We did not have to
stay at school as Miss Cloney 
was not there. Mamma went 
out on a collecting trip. We lost
our neighors yesterday. 
Beatrice brought me a programme 
of the Musical this afternoon.
Papa came home to-night
and brought mamma a pair
of rubber gloves and me two 
pieces. "Salome" by Wm. Loraine
and Ben-Hur Waltzes by Charles Hoffman 
They are very pretty.
