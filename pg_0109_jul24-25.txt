July 24
I went collecting for Mamma.
Was to Mrs Reynolds,
Coy's and Mrs Smith's. Got the
money at every place
Was at Mrs Smith's quite a
while. Then went up to
Wilson's. They drove out
to Overholt's with three
large bass, Lizzie was
down, and Ella brought us
a lovely bunch of sweet 
peas. Got "Ladie's [sic] Home Journal
for August. Has a sweet story
"The Story of a Song." Schubert's love story



July 25
I had to take the money
to the church to-day.
There was only Mrs
Chatfield, Mr Perry & Mrs
Wyatt there. I was asked by
Mr Perry "if I was general
collector for this month".
Waited for the names. Got
some fancy biscuits at Lee's.
Papa & Mr Overholt came
home to-night. Papa
brought me some porcupine
quills, two hawks feet & a
porcupine's foot. He drove Mr
Overholt home.
