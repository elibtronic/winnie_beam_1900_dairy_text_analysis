July 19
Rode up to Smith's for meat,
He has quit giving trading
stamps. I hope I do not
lose my book. Mamma
went collecting in afternoon.
She was at Woods to see if
they wanted to try trading stamps
but they had all they wanted as
they quit giving out 1{st} August.
I went over to Leta's in the
afternoon. And when I came
away she went with me to
Allie's as I wanted to get
the address of "The Etude". Mamma
and I went for a drive at night.
"The Musician" came to-night. The 
Welland Vale & Kinleith Paper Co. bylaw passed.
