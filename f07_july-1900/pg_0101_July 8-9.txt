July 9
Very chilly and damp to-day.
Practiced 2 hours to-day 
as it was cool. They 
intended having the
electric cars running to Falls
to-day but the President
Mr. Powers was out 
of the city. Had an 
excursion in the Park
to-day. Very nice day 
for once. Mr & Mrs. Dwyer
were over in the evenening. 
Papa & mamma were
hunting dew worms
this evening.
