Miss McFarlane brought my
music last night. Took my
lesson. Took "Harlequin" by
H. N. Bartlett for my lesson.
Have the first chorale in
Harmony for next week. Went
to Dwyer's to ask Beatrice to
play. Saw their new dog & cats.
Got ten pictures from the
Perry Pictures last night. Have a
cold. Went and had my
waist tried on. She will not
have it done until Monday.

Eva was in as usual on
Sunday morning. Had her hair
all frizzed. She is going to get
2 dozen scarfpins to sell and
get a watch. Went to
church. Sermon Gen. 25. 27 verse.
Instead of having a Friday
evening service they are
going to have a Bible
class. Papa went down
to the old maris[?] who let
him have Dewey with
a piece of venison. Did not
go to Sunday School. Mamma
has a bad cold.
