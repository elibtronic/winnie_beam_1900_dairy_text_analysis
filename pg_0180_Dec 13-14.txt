Was in the house all day.

puff in the Journal. Papa, 
manna & I went over to 
Dwyer’s at night. All the 
old Club were there. Mr 
Pay was late. I nearly got

Eva was in at noon and 
she has her watch. A very 
nice little nickel one. 
She had her pictures taken 
and brought me one. 
Mamma had to go to 
the church to quilt.
Am reading the “Etude”
now.
