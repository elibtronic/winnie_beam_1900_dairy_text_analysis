I went over to Jones to 
inquire how Mrs Jones was 
and took her 3 trout.
The men came and took
down the stoves. Mamma
went uptown bought
enough pique for me a dress.
Called for Lulu then went to 
Hendersons and met Daisy
Ratcliffe. The programme opened
with a piano quartette. Mr
Read was Chairman and read
the same paper as he read at 
Musical. Had eating afterwards.
