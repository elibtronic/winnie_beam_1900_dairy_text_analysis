Still a roaster. The two
boys that were drowned
on Wednesday were buried
yesterday in one grave.
Beatrice has to play in
St. Paul St. Church to-morrow
as Miss Vanderburgh is away
Got the "Parish & Home" to-night,
and Mr & Mrs Perry have gone
visiting to Georgian Bay
Rained a little in the
afternoon.

Much cooler. Too much of
a change. Did not go to
Church in the morning
or evening but went to
Sunday School Mrs Haun
is back and we are all
glad. They had a young
man this morning, and
next Sunday I think Mr Weaver
of Beamsville, then Mr Miller
The lesson was Matt XVIII 21-36
Papa & mamma started for
a drive but it rained. Dr
Comfort came back with Papa
then when it cleared they
started again. Tommy paid
us a visit to-night
