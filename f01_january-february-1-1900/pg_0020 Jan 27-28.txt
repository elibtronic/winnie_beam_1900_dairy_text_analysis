January Saturday 27 1900
Took my music lesson. Had 
to go to Eckardts after a piece
"Picrrette" by Chamiande Op 41
About tweleve o'clock two  
women called with a book
they were thrying to sell and 
were more bother than their 
worth. Mamma & I went 
uptown. I took Mr Henderson's
umbrella home. I bought 
three sponge taffy squares as I 
had 3 coppers. Mr Overholt came 
here. Papa went up to meet him 
and they did not get back until 2 o'clock


Sunday 28 
Papa & Mr Overhold saw Charlie 
Gould. Did not go to church as 
it was after time when we 
got up from breakfast. About 
12 o'clock Charlie & Mr Dean 
a friend of his came down.
When they went to catch 2.45 
train Mr Overhold went with 
them. Went to Sunday School 
The lesson was the 
"Temptation of Jesus" Did not 
go at night as Mamma 
said she would go to 
sleep as was up so 
late last night.
