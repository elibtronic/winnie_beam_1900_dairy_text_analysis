January Saturday 13 1900
Took my music lesson. Took No
27. Funeral March in "Songs without 
Words" by Mendelssohn & the 7th Etude 
Zennys 49th. Mr Read heard I did very well 
Thursday. Mrs Camp told him. Went 
uptown in the afternoon to get
premium trading stamps. They 
stamp ten instead of giving 
stamps. Went down to Miss 
Crawford's Miss McLaren was 
there. Did not get home until 
nearly six. 


Sunday 14 
Did not go to Church in the morning
as it is very rainy and sloppy. 
Then in the afternoon did not 
go to Sunday School as it was 
raining harder still. Papa is reading 
in Tents of Kedar. I have been reading 
the Musicains. There is one very good 
article on "The Development of Technique 
from Bach to Lisst' We did not 
go to Church as it was
rainy again. Wish we did not 
have rainy Sundays. I finished 
In Tents of Kedar to-night
