February Monday 26 1900 
It was very cold and I did 
not go to school. The Ladies 
Home Journal came to-day
The club meets here to-night
They were all here expect 
Armstrongs and McGhies. 
Mr Pay won the gentleman's 
prize Mrs Macgregor the ladies
and Mrs Notman the booky [?]
As we were eating lunch 
the cannons started to go 
off and we though Ladysmith 
was relieved some, Mr Macgregor is 
not going to clean his boots until it is relieved.


Tuesday 27 
It was a false report about 
Ladysmith, but Cronje had 
surrendered. They had a 
partriotic concert in the opera
House last night for Red Cross
fund. Mamma went uptown in
afternoon and I went afer 
to the Post office and library
I sent for three pieces of 10 count 
musc from Denton Cottier & Daniels 
Buffalo. They were at the Spring by Liszt
Two Lakes by Lesschetizby, and Tannerhauser
March by Wager. I got the "Heavenly 
Twins" out of the Library. Mamma
got a color cord [?] and the 
color are grouped so harmoniously 
Phoebe got a letter from Jennie Tucker
