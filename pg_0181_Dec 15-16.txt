Mr. Read was not at Mrs Campbell’s 
when I got there so little Lloyd 
Carpenter played me a piece and
said “That is my lesson“ Took my 
lesson. They have started a Musical 
in Port. Got the “Etude” to-day. 
Like it very much. It is a Wagner 
number. Went uptown. Bought 
a calendar for Lizzie. Got some 
grey matting for my little pictures 
of musicians. Bought mamma’s 
present a little oak tabourette. 
Got the matting ready for the pictures
