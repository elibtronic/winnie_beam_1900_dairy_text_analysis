September 2
Very warm. Did not go to church
all day. Read "Tempest and
Sunshine" Eva and Tom
over and Tom was chasing
poor Dexter. Eva brought a
paper with a continued story
in it over. Mrs Tulley and
Dr Abbott had tea here.
Mamma, Mrs Tulley and I
had a walk.



September 3
Had a candy braom [??] given
me. Eva bought us all
some candy Mr Pay was over
and wanted to buy our
pears and some Crawford
peaches. We intended going
to the sixteen for a picnic,
but the rain prevented
us. There was a gentleman
here looking after Fitzgerald's
house. Eva lent me
another book. "Three Men
on Wheels" by Jerome. Eva &
Tom were over nearly all day.
Mr Taylor is picking pears.
