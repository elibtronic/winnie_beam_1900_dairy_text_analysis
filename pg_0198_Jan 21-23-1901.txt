The Queen is not expected 
to live. Mamma had to go 
to Mrs. Sullivan’s. She changed 
my library book. Got Ursula 
Vivian by Anne Swan. Read it 
to–night. Beatrice came over 
in the afternoon to see me. 
Mr Murphy is here until 
Wednesday. 



Tuesday 22nd
A very fine day. The Queen 
died this morning at 6.30 and 
the Prince is now King Edward 
VII. Eva was in. I went up 
to Miss Boyle’s to try my 
waist on after so long a 
time. Mamma went to the 
church to the service then 
uptown to buy me an 
apron. Mrs Kilner was 
down & mamma was away 
as usual.



Wednesday 23rd
Papa brought a man home with 
him at noon. He is going to put 
a hot air pipe in Phoebe’s room. 
I went to church this 
afternoon. Mr Murphy 
spoke on how to read the Bible.
