November 13

The first good snowstorm
of the season. Mr Lee
brought a basket of
Baldwin apples. Snow
turned to rain. Wrote to
Bessie Corvie. Was going
after the papers, but it
was too bad. "Way Down
East" last night was
not very good. Mamma is
making us some Battenburg[?]
ends for ties.

About 2 o'clock Uncle Freeman
came in as he had been
to port for sand. We
were waiting dinner for
papa. as he is coming
home. Came with his
deer. The one is a fine
buck. I went uptown
after the papers and
mail. Had dinner so
late we did not have
any tea. Then Mamma
went with me to the
Church. Mr Perry wants
Beatrice and I to play Friday night
We just had business tonight
about the reception.
