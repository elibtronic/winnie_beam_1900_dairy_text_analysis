October 6

Took my music lesson.
Had 1{st} piece Bolero Op 26 Jadassohn
for lesson. Mr Read said that it
and valse. Op 1 by Wrangell would
be good ones for musical.
Mrs Overholt was in for
a few minutes on her way
home. Papa drove to grandpas
to-night. Took Dexter. Eva
brought me two pieces of
music she got at the fair.



October 7

Went to church in the
morning. Sermon Psalm 51.
Staid [sic] to Communion. Eva came
over and said she was
going to our Sunday
School as she went to Jones
and she & Jessie came after me.
We had a special offering for
the expenses of Sunday School.
We got $13.51. Pretty good for kids.
Poured as we were ready to
come home. Nellie Lloyd lent me
her heptonette[?]. Met mamma
coming after me. St George's
re-opened to-day. St Barnabus
had a Harvest Home service
