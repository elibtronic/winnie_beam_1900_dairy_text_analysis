October 10

Cool and frosty. Mamma was
going uptown so I got 
ready and went with her.
She went to Mrs Sullivan's
to see about our clothes.
We were at Miss
Anderson's and mamma
picked out a very
pretty hat. I changed
the library book and
got 'Mr Faversham's New Years 
guest".

Mamma cleaned the little
front room to-day. In afternoon
mamma went to call on 
Ms Read who was staying
at Dwyer's. She was gone and
mamma was in Mrs Pay's
for a while. Miss Nora McSloy
had a "Book Tea" yesterday.
Allie won first prize.
I had to go to Lee's saw
Ella and when I came
home Eva was here with
some popcorn.
