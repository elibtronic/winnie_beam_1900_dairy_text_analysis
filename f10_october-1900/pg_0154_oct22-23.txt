October 22

Very warm. Mamma cleaned
their bedroom. We went 
for a drive in the
afternoon. Drove up to Mrs
Sullivan's. She measured me
for my green skirt. It is to
be 41 inches in front & 42 in back.
Went to office after balm
and some certificates of 
papa's. He went to Falls 
on 7 o'clock trolley to get
his license. Saw Mrs
Pay.

her cousin over. Mamma
had to go to the office
to have her teeth
fixed. Papa got the October

is going to stay here all
night. Her cousin is going 
to stay at Carmans.
