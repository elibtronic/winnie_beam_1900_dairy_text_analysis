Jany [sic]	Wed 2nd        1901
Have been working at a 
very pretty doily. Mamma 
went uptown in the afternoon. 
Wanted her to get a Golden Text 
Book for 1901 but they were all gone. 
Leta was over to see me 
in the afternoon. She got 
some very nice Xmas presents. 
Eva was over. Borrowed a book. 
Allie, papa & I went to church at night. 
Mr Perry gave us slips of paper with 
names on them for impromptu speeches. 
Mine was “Santa Claus” Mr. Reavely, Mr Read 
& Allie played & Mr Rothwell sang. Papa’s

Thursday 3rd
 speech was on “Bad Habits”. We had 
 lots of fun. I finished my 
 doily all but the border. 
 Papa brought a shield home 
 at night for the deer’s head 
 & mounted it. Mamma made 
 me a shawl for evenings the 
 other day. She wore it to–night 
 as she & papa went over to 
 Kennedy’s to spend the evening. 
 Mr & Mrs Coy were there. Mr Skey [?] 
 was presented & Saturday 
 evening was presented by the 
 Young People of Merriton with 
 a surplice & stole before he left 
 for Hamilton.
