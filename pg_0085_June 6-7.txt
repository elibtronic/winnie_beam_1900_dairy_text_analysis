June 6
The curtains for the hall & kitchen
windows came this morning.
The hall ones have lace on.
I finished the "Castle Inn."
A very good story of its kind
but they can hardly say
a word without swearing.
Aunt Lillie and Uncle Horace
came to-night after tea
Papa & Uncle Horace took Rex
up to Murphy's livery
stable.



June 7
Uncle Horace and Aunt Lillie
went uptown shopping
and did not get back until
dinner. Then Aunt Lillie &
mamma drove down to
Waite's in the afternoon
after tea Mrs Haun came
down. Played some for her
then we all went up
to hear the first band
concert of the season
They played two new hymms
from England.
