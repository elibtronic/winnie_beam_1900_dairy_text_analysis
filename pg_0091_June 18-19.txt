Mamma & I drove to Decew Falls
in afternoon. Stopped to get
some wild strawberries
that grow on a small hill
in a field as you turn to
go to Decew. They were dried
up. Got a few. Then we got
some more beyond the
Falls. Got an invitation to
Demill Commencement
exercises next week. Lizzie
was down to get Dr. Macfarlane's
address for Maud Rottineier.
