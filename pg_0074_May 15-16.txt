Sorted it. The men have
torn up the boulevard
to-day and are laying
a granolithic sidewalk

than yeserday. Had
thunderstorms. In Hayne's Avenue

About 3 o' clock this morning
mamma came in my room and
said "If you want to see a big
fire come & see it. And it was
the Welland Vale bicycle
& Axe factory. Papa went down
and mamma & I waited until
about 4 o'clock then went to bed.
Finished the sidewalk to-day.
I went uptown in afternoon
called for Helen and Belle McClive,
she & I walked to Black Bridge

Nurseries staid [sic] here all
night as she is having some
work done and does not
knoiw anyone here. Lizzie was down.
