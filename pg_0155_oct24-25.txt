Eva staid [sic] all night. We put her
in the spare room but she came
and slept with me. They took
her uncle away this morning
Ethel came after her and she had
to go to school. Mamma went
to Mrs Sullivan's and she
was not ready. She won't be ready
for me to-morrow. Phoebe is
going to have Miss Boyle make her
skirt. Papa went to see
Mr Sidney Bunting at
night.
