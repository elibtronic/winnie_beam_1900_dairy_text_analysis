October 22

Very warm. Mamma cleaned
their bedroom. We went
for a drive in the
afternoon. Drove up to Mrs
Sullivan's. She measured me
for my green skirt. It is to
be 41 inches in front & 42 in back.
Went to office after balm
and some certificates of
papa's. He went to Falls
on 7 o'clock trolley to get
his license. Saw Mrs
Pay.

night. Her cousin is going
to stay at Carmans.
